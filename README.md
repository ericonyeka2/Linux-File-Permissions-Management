# Linux File Permissions Management

## Objective  
This project demonstrates how to manage and audit file permissions in a Linux environment. The task involved ensuring appropriate authorization was enforced across system files and directories, following the principle of least privilege. This helped secure access while gaining hands-on experience with Linux command-line tools.

## Skills Learned  
- Interpreting Linux permission strings  
- Modifying file and directory access using `chmod` and `chown`  
- Handling hidden files and recursive permission changes  
- Enforcing least privilege principles  
- Command-line navigation and file system management  

## Tools Used  
- Linux terminal (bash)  
- Commands: `ls -l`, `chmod`, `ls -a`, `chmod -R`, `chown`
