# Linux File Permissions Management

## Objective  
This project demonstrates how to manage and audit file permissions in a Linux environment. The task involved ensuring appropriate authorization was enforced across system files and directories, following the principle of least privilege. This helped secure access while gaining hands-on experience with Linux command-line tools.

## Skills Learned  
- Interpreting Linux permission strings  
- Modifying file and directory access using `chmod` and `chown`  
- Handling hidden files and recursive permission changes  
- Enforcing least privilege principles  
- Command-line navigation and file system management  

## Tools Used  
- Linux terminal (bash)  
- Commands: `ls -l`, `chmod`, `ls -a`, `chmod -R`, `chown`

## Conclusion  
Managing file permissions is a critical aspect of maintaining a secure Linux-based system. In this project, I reviewed and updated the permissions for various files and directories within the projects directory to ensure they aligned with my organizationâ€™s access policies. By using commands such as ls -la to inspect current permissions and chmod to modify them, I was able to control which users and groups could read, write, or execute specific files. This hands-on experience has reinforced my understanding of Linux file permission structures and the importance of enforcing the principle of least privilege in a real-world environment.
